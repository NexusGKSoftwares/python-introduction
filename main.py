# what is python?
#  high intergrated programming language
#  it is widely used in many fields such as web development, data analysis, machine learning, automation, etc.

#  it is easy to learn and use, and it has a large and active community of developers

# key features of python:
# 1. easy to learn and use
# 2. high level language
# 3. interpreted language
# 4. object oriented
# 5 open source and community driven
# 6. cross platform

# installation of python
# 1. download the python installer from the official python website
# 2. follow the installation instructions to install python on your computer

# test the installation of python
# python --version

# running python code in vs code
# 1. open vs code
# 2. create a new file or open an existing file
# 3. write python code in the file
# 4. save the file with a .py extension
# 5. click on the run button or press f5 to run the code
# 6. the output will be displayed in the output panel
# 7. you can also use the terminal to run python code by typing python and then file name 
# 8. you can also use the debugger to debug your code

# first topic

# python syntax,variables and data types
# 1. python syntax
# deals with indentation

# example of python syntax code 
# print("hello world") # this is a print statement(output is - hello world)

# print() - is a function in python that is used to print output to the screen

# 2.variables and data types
# variables are used to store data in python
# data types are used to define the type of data that a variable can hold

# example
# name = "john" 
# age = 25 
# df = "gideon"
# print(name) # output is - john
# print(age) # output is - 25
# print(df)

# data types in python
# 1. integer 
# 2. string
# 3. float
# 4. boolean
# 5. list
# 6. tuple
# 7. dictionary
# 8. set
# 9. complex
# 10. bytes

# 1. integer
#  it is a whole number, positive or negative, without a fractional part.
# example
# age = 25
# print(age) # output is - 25

# 2. string
# it is a sequence of characters, such as a word or phrase, enclosed in quotes.
# example
# name = "john"
# print(name) # output is - john

# 3. float
# it is a real number, positive or negative, with a fractional part.decimal number
# example
# height = 5.5
# print(height) # output is - 5.5

# 4. boolean
# it is a logical value that can be either true or false.
# example
# is_adult = True
# print(is_adult) # output is - True

# is_male = False
# print(is_male) # output is - False


# comments
# comments are used to add notes to your code, they are ignored by the interpreter.
# comments makes the code understable
# there are two types of comments in python
# 1. single line comment 
#  it is denoted by # symbol
# example
# # this is a comment
# print("hello world") # this is a comment and a print statement
# 2. multi line comment
# it is denoted by """ """ or ''' ''' symbol
# example

'''
what is python?
python is a high level language
it is easy to learn and use

# input/output 
# input: it is used to get input from the user
# output: it is used to display output to the user

# example
# name = input("what is your name? ")
# print("hello " + name) # output is - hello your name
# output is - hello your name

# example of a password
password = input("enter your password: ")
print("your password is: " + password) # output is - your password is: your password
# output is - your password is: your password
